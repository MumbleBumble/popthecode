<h1>Why?</h1>
<div class="main-image">
    <div class="main-text">
        <p>Suppose you're at dinner with a friend. Midway through dinner, you begin to argue over a certain site you've both visited.</p>
        <p>"Come on!", he insists, "you know as well as I do that that entire site was done in bootstrap! Just look at the navbar!"</p>
        <p>Unperturbed, you decide to prove him wrong (the site was clearly made with normalize). You reach into your pocket and pull out your iPhone...</p>
        <p>Only to realize you don't feel like mucking about with irritating "bookmarklets" (whatever <i>those</i> are) or bending over backwards to buy (<b>BUY!</b>) an app just so you can see some page source. How un-free (as in free speech) is <i>that</i>?
        <p>Fortunately, you don't have to. With PopTheCode.com you can simply pop the hood and take a look at what's happening behind the scenes. Even if you're at your computer, you can use PopTheCode.com to see what a site would look like if you were viewing it from another browser, or another device</p>
        <p>So jump to it!</p>
    <h1>How?</h1>
    <div class="text" align="center">
        <p>By the magic of Python. Really, it's not that complicated.</p>
        <p>Forgoing both bootstrap and normalize (shudder), PopTheCode.com was sloppily coded and styled by hand.</p>
